  SQuad (acronym for "Some Simple Script Samples" or "Sx4")
+---------------------------------------------------------------+

ABOUT:
-------
This is the bundle of sample scripts that worked as a basis for the talk:
"The Forgotten Art of Automation - 12 Concrete Scripts That Will Free Your Energies",
held at the JavaZone conference in September 2011.

APOLOGY:
---------
The tree structure may be a little bit misguiding, for instance by providing
a folder called "groovy", and another one called "jython". These were part
of my original plan for the 12 scripts, but had to yield for other scripts
due to a combination of time (lack of), ownership of code (lack of), and perhaps
most importantly: skills (lack of). The folders have not been deleted from 
this "repository" due to the simple fact that I never gave up the idea of making
these scripts (still haven't), but they did not make it in time to "JavaZone X".

HOWTO / GETTING STARTED:
-------------------------
* Maven projects:
Some of the sub-modules need to be built using maven (see root pom.xml file).
More specifically, these modules are:
    - "java/wiki-test" 
    - "java/SampleJuanApplication"

To be able to import them in eclipse, run "mvn eclipse:eclipse". This will 
create ".project" files so that the modules can be imported in Eclipse.

* Non-maven projects:
For the other projects, the .project (and some other dot-files) have
been put under version control. These can be opened directly without
running any maven goals.

* Eclipse plugins:
 > aspectj plugin for eclipse is needed if you want to run JUAN-ified projects
from within eclipse (maven plugins will be automatically downloaded
when building the modules, ... I think!). 
 > Read the "./bash/README" file for tips on BASH-plugin to Eclipse.
 > The ".project" and ".pydevproject" files in the root folder contain
eclipse settings that require a Jython installation on the development
machine, along with the PyDev plugin for eclipse. The PyDev plugin can
be downloaded (or added as an eclipse installation update site)
at: http://pydev.org/updates.
 > Never found out how to maven-ify grovy! It's a long-shot "TODO"!
