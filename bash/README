Eclipse users:
----------------
The .project file in this folder is added to version control for those
who want to look at or edit the files using Eclipse.

ShellEd plugin (eclipse)
-------------------------
For content assist, markup colors and "API help on hover", install the
Eclipse plugin "ShellEd" v1.0.4. (did not get later versions to work with 
newer versions of Eclipse). Unfortunately the plugin must be downloaded and
put manually in Eclipse's plugins directory (and you must restart eclipse).
